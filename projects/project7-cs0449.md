# CS0449(Spring 2019) Intro to Systems Programming Projects (University of Pittsburgh)

https://github.com/xingchenzhao/cs449-Intro-to-Systems-Programming-

## Course Outline

**Goal:**
This course covers topics related to the interface of hardware and software. It covers device interfaces and hardware synchronization at the lowest level of the operating system, the linkage of operating system services to application software, and the fundamental mechanisms for computer communications.

## Projects

# Project1
The first program is called Hangman which is a game for guessing words.
The second program is a Wav Editor.**
# Project2
This project was very difficult. Implement a custom malloc function. This required thinking about how malloc worked and how objects and pointers in memory were stored. We need to find the passwords that needed to be entered into the programs, given 3 compiled executables. This task required decompiling to assembly, by using gdb and other techniques.
# Project3
We need to implement a custom malloc program which required thinking about how malloc worked and how objects and pointers in memory were stored.
# Project4
We need to implement a costom shell program involved using threading and syscalls.
