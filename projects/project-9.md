# CS0447 Computer Organization and Assembly Language Projects (University Course)

https://github.com/xingchenzhao/cs447

## Course Outline

**Goal:**
The purpose of this course is to study the components of computing systems common to most computer architectures. In particular, this class is meant to introduce data representation, types of processors, memory types and hierarchy, and device drivers. The students will learn MIPS assembly language, the design of arithmetic and logic units, and basic designs for RISC processors.## Projects

# Project1
**Morse Code Converter** that can convert a string of letters into a Morse code and vice versa.
# Project2
Initialize **a Minesweeper game and read mouse input**
# Project3
**Minesweeper Game** with full functions.
# Project4
**A 16-bit unsigned division hardware and an 8-bit unsigned square root hardware**
