# CS0445(Fall 2018) Data Structure Projects (University of Pittsburgh)

https://github.com/xingchenzhao/cs445

## Course Plan

**Goal:**
This course emphasizes the study of the basic data structures of computer science (stacks, queues, trees, lists) and their implementations using the java language included in this study are programming techniques which use recursion, reference variables, and dynamic memory allocation. Students in this course are also introduced to various searching and sorting methods and also expected to develop an intuitive understanding of the complexity of these algorithms.

## Projects

- a1: **Groceries** is a representation of a shopping "list", though it is unordered
  and does not permit duplicates. It uses the a1.Set data structure to store a
  collection of GroceryItems.
- a2: **Calculator for infix and postfix arithmetic expression**
- a3: **Sudoku Solver** using backtracking technique
- a4: **A abstract data type** represents the backend for a streaming radio service. It stores the songs, stations, and users in the system, as well as the ratings that users assign to songs.
- a5: **Implements Tenary Tree**
